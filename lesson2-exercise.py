# Find the area of a regular hexagon where a is the length of one of the sides.
# A should be able to be any value!
# The formula to find this is:
# ((3√3)➗2) ✖ (a2)
# Square root is also to the power ½
# Put all fractions in () otherwise it might not work!


a = 6
first_half = (3*(3**(1/2)))/2
second_half = a**2
area = ((first_half))*(a**2)
